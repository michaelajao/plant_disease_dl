Plant Disease DL
==============================

Plant diseases are a major threat to crop yield and quality, and their early detection is essential for effective management and prevention. However, traditional methods of plant disease detection rely on manual inspection by experts, which is costly, time-consuming, and prone to errors. Therefore, there is a need for an automated, robust, and accurate plant disease detection system that can leverage the advances in digital image processing and deep learning.
